## Aim: 
Inverse Kinematics using Arduino

## Introduction:
In this assignment, we explore **Inverse Kinematics (IK)** for robotic arm manipulation. We'll implement IK using **C++** on a Microcontroller and analyze the movements of robotic arms. This experiment aims to understand and apply IK principles while examining the practicalities of controlling robotic arm motion.
